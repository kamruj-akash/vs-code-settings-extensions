Are you spending valuable time repeatedly typing document.getElementById or .addEventListener in your web development projects?

As developers, we constantly write this kind of boilerplate code, which can be repetitive and slow down our workflow. I recently found an effective solution by leveraging a powerful feature in Visual Studio Code: Custom Code Snippets.

This feature allows us to create our own shortcuts for frequently used code, making our development process faster and more efficient.

Here’s how you can set it up:

1️⃣ In VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac).
2️⃣ Type Configure User Snippets in the search bar and select the javascript.json file.
3️⃣ Copy the code below and paste it into your javascript.json file, then save it:

{
  "Get Element By ID": {
    "prefix": "gid",
    "body": ["document.getElementById('$1')"],
    "description": "Select an element by its ID"
  },
  "Get Elements By Class Name": {
    "prefix": "gclass",
    "body": ["document.getElementsByClassName('$1')"],
    "description": "Select elements by class name"
  },
  "Add Event Listener": {
    "prefix": "ael",
    "body": [".addEventListener('$1', function() {", "\t$2", "});"],
    "description": "Add an event listener to an element"
  }
}


After setting this up, you can simply type gid and press Enter to get document.getElementById(''), with your cursor placed directly inside the quotes.

Small automations like this are incredibly effective for boosting productivity. What are your favorite VS Code tricks? Feel free to share in the comments.
